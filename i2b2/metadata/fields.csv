Table,Field,Required,Ref Table,Ref Field,Type,Definitioni2b2,c_hlevel,Yes,,,number(22),The C_HLEVEL is the hierarchical level of the term. The term at the highest level of a hierarchy has a value of 0 and the next level has a value of 1 and so on.i2b2,c_fullname,Yes,,,text(700),"The C_FULLNAME is the hierarchical path that leads to the term, each back slash representing another hierarchical level."i2b2,c_name,Yes,,,text(700),The C_NAME is the descriptive text value for the term. It is what is displayed in the user interface.i2b2,c_synonym_cd,Yes,,,text(1),"The C_SYNONYM_CD is a Boolean field that indicates whether the item is a synonym for another term or not. A 'Y' in this field denotes that the field is a synonym, while a 'N' means this is the original term. The default value is 'N' so all terms start out with 'N' and if a synonym is added it gets the value of 'Y'. Two or more synonyms of each other will have the same C_BASECODE (defined below)."i2b2,c_visualattributes,Yes,,,text(3),The C_VISUALATTRIBUTES column describes how the field looks in the user interface.  See https://www.i2b2.org/software/files/PDF/current/Ontology_Design.pdf for details.i2b2,c_totalnum,No,,,number(22),"If available, the C_TOTALNUM indicates the total number of patient have that concept. Since a single modifier can apply to more than one concept, this column is not used and does not apply for modifiers."i2b2,c_basecode,No,,,text(50),"The C_BASECODE is the term that describes the ontological concept.

Or it may be any number of other coding systems, even home-grown ones."i2b2,c_metadataxml,No,,,text(x),The C_METADATAXML is an optional field to store extra information about the concept in xml format. It is currently used to describe value metadata associated with a lab finding.i2b2,c_facttablecolumn,Yes,,,text950),"Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_FACTTABLECOLUMN is the name of a key in the fact table (OBSERVATION_FACT) that links to the dimension code we are querying for.  Typical entries will be CONCEPT_CD, PATIENT_NUM, ENCOUNTER_NUM, or PROVIDER_ID."i2b2,c_tablename,Yes,,,text(50),"Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_TABLENAME is the name of the dimension table that holds the metadata to fact linkings. Typical entries will be CONCEPT_CD, PATIENT_NUM, ENCOUNTER_NUM, or PROVIDER_ID."i2b2,c_columnname,Yes,,,text(50),"Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_COLUMNNAME is the name of the field in the C_TABLENAME that holds the dimension code we are querying for. Typical entries might be CONCEPT_PATH, BIRTH_DATE, INCOME_CD, INOUT_CD, LENGTH_OF_STAY, or PROVIDER_PATH."i2b2,c_columndatatype,Yes,,,text(50),Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_COLUMNDATATYPE is either 'T' for text or 'N' for numeric and describes the data type of the concept or term.i2b2,c_operator,Yes,,,text(10),Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_OPERATOR is any valid SQL operator used in the WHERE clause of the metadata SELECT SQL query.i2b2,c_dimcode,Yes,,,text(700),Used to help construct a metadata SELECT SQL query that runs behind the scenes. The intent of this query is to link the dimension tables to the fact table for a given term. As a result every metadata SELECT SQL statement should return a fact table key. The C_DIMCODE is the actual value of the dimension table C_COLUMNNAME that we are querying for.i2b2,c_comment,No,,,text(x),The C_COMMENT is an optional column to store miscellaneous comments about the term.i2b2,c_tooltip,No,,,text(900),The C_TOOLTIP is the tooltip that appears in the user interface for a given term. It is usually the C_FULLNAME with spaces around the backslash ('\') for readability.i2b2,m_applied_path,Yes,,,text(700),"Introduced in 1.6 to support modifier term within the metadata table, the M_APPLIED_PATH is the CONCEPT_PATH that the term applies to. Traditional (non-modifier) concept terms have a M_APPLIED_PATH of '@'. An M_APPLIED_PATH of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\%' means that the term is a modifier that applies to the term(s) with C_FULLNAME of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' and all its descendants, whereas a M_APPLIED_PATH of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' applies to the term with C_FULLNAME of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' only."i2b2,update_date,Yes,,,timestamp,The UPDATE_DATE is the date the data was updated.i2b2,download_date,No,,,timestamp,The DOWNLOAD_DATE is the date the data was downloaded.i2b2,import_date,No,,,timestamp,The IMPORT_DATE is the date the data was imported.i2b2,sourcesystem_cd,No,,,text(50),The SOURCESYSTEM_CD is a coded value for the source system from which the data was loaded or derived.i2b2,valuetype_cd,No,,,text(50),The VALUETYPE_CD is a coded value indicating the type of term. At present there are two values in use: 'DOC' indicates the terms represents documents or notes.  'LAB' indicates the term is of a laboratory test naturei2b2,m_exclusion_cd,No,,,text(25),"Introduced in 1.6 to support modifier terms within the metadata table, a non-null ('X') M_EXCLUSION_CD indicates the modifier is to be excluded from the specified applied path. Traditional concept terms and non-exclusion modifiers have an M_EXCLUSION_CD of null. An M_APPLIED_PATH of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\%' and M_EXCLUSION_CD of 'X' means that the term is a modifier that is excluded from the term(s) with C_FULLNAME of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' and all its descendants, whereas a M_APPLIED_PATH of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' applies to the term with C_FULLNAME of '\Diagnoses\Circulatory system\' only."i2b2,c_path,No,,,text(700),"A subset of C_FULLNAME; its meant to contain the C_FULLNAME of the node's parent. A node's C_PATH, concatenated with its C_SYMBOL (below) form the node's C_FULLNAME."i2b2,c_symbol,No,,,text(50),"The C_SYMBOL is a unique, abbreviated form of the node's C_NAME. A nodes C_SYMBOL, prepended with its C_PATH (above) for the node's C_FULLNAME."
