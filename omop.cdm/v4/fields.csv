Examples include ‘DRUG’, ‘CONDITION’, ‘PROCEDURE’, ‘PROCEDURE DRUG’ etc. It is important to pick the appropriate mapping record when the same source code is being mapped to different concepts in different contexts. As an example a procedure code for drug administration can be mapped to a procedure concept or a drug concept or both. "
source_to_concept_map,primary_map,No,,,string(1),,"A boolean value identifying the primary mapping relationship for those sets where the source_code, the source_vocabulary_id and the mapping type is identical (one-to-many mappings). The ETL will only consider the primary map. Permitted values are Y and NULL. "
source_to_concept_map,valid_start_date,Yes,,,date,,The date when the mapping instance was first recorded.
source_to_concept_map,valid_end_date,Yes,,,date,,The date when the mapping instance became invalid because it was deleted or superseded (updated) by a new relationship. Default value is 31-Dec-2099.
source_to_concept_map,invalid_reason,No,,,string(1),,"Reason the mapping instance was invalidated. Possible values are D (deleted), U (replaced with an update) or NULL when valid_end_date has the default value. "
relationship,relationship_id,Yes,,,integer,,The type of relationship captured by the relationship record.
relationship,relationship_name,Yes,,,string(256),,The text that describes the relationship type.
relationship,is_hierarchical,No,,,string(1),,Defines whether a relationship defines concepts into classes or hierarchies. Values are Y for hierarchical relationship or NULL if not.
relationship,defines_ancestry,No,,,string(1),,Defines whether a hierarchical relationship contributes to the concept_ancestor table. These are subsets of the hierarchical relationships. Valid values are Y or NULL.
