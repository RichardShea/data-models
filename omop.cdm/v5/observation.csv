observation,observation_date,Yes,,,date,,The date of the observation. 
observation,observation_id,Yes,,,integer,,A system-generated unique identifier for each observation. 
observation,observation_source_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,A foreign key to a concept that refers to the code used in the source. 
observation,observation_source_value,No,,,varchar(50),,"The observation code as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard concept in the vocabulary and the original code is, stored here for reference. "
observation,observation_time,No,,,time,,The time of the observation.
observation,observation_type_concept_id,Yes,concept,concept_id,integer,OMOP,A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the vocabulary reflecting the type of the observation. 
observation,person_id,Yes,person,person_id,integer,,A foreign key identifier to the person about whom the observation was recorded. The demographic details of that person are stored in the person table. 
observation,provider_id,No,provider,provider_id,integer,,A foreign key to the provider in the provider table who was responsible for making the observation. 
observation,qualifier_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,"A foreign key to a standard concept identifier for a qualifier (e.g., severity of drug-drug interaction alert) "
observation,qualifier_source_value,No,,,varchar(50),,The source value associated with a qualifier to characterize the observation 
observation,range_high,No,,,float,,"The upper limit of the normal range of the observation. It is not applicable if the observation results are non- numeric or categorical, and must be in the same units of measure as the observation value. "
observation,range_low,No,,,float,,"The lower limit of the normal range of the observation. It is not applicable if the observation results are non- numeric or categorical, and must be in the same units of measure as the observation value. "
observation,relevant_condition_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,SNOMED,"A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the vocabulary reflecting the condition that was associated with the observation. Note that this is not a direct reference to a specific condition record in the condition table, but rather a condition concept in the vocabulary. "

observation,value_as_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,"A foreign key to an observation result stored as a concept identifier. This is applicable to observations where the result can be expressed as a standard concept from the vocabulary (e.g., positive/negative, present/absent, low/high, etc.). "
observation,value_as_number,No,,,float,,The observation result stored as a number. This is applicable to observations where the result is expressed as a numeric value.
observation,value_as_string,No,,,varchar(60),,"The observation result stored as a varchar. This is applicable to observations where the result is expressed as verbatim text, such as in radiology or pathology reports. "
