measurement,measurement_date,Yes,,,date,,The date of the measurement (UTC).
measurement,measurement_id,Yes,,,integer,,A system-generated unique identifier for each measurement
measurement,measurement_source_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,A foreign key to a concept that refers to the code used in the source.
measurement,measurement_source_value,Yes,,,varchar,,"The measurement name as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference."
measurement,measurement_time,No,,,datetime,,The time of the measurement (UTC).
measurement,measurement_type_concept_id,Yes,concept,concept_id,integer,,A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the Vocabulary reflecting the type of the measurement.
measurement,operator_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,"A foreign key identifier to the mathematical operator that is applied to the value_as_number.Operators are <, ≤, =, ≥, >"
measurement,person_id,Yes,person,person_id,integer,,A foreign key identifier to the person who the measurement is being documented for. The demographic details of that person are stored in the person table.
measurement,provider_id,No,,,integer,,A foreign key to the provider in the provider table who was responsible for making the measurement.
measurement,range_high,No,,,float,,"The upper limit of the normal range of the measurement. It is not applicable if the observation results are non-numeric or categorical, and must be in the same units of measure as the measurement value."
measurement,range_low,No,,,float,,"The lower limit of the normal range of the measurement. It is not applicable if the observation results are non-numeric or categorical, and must be in the same units of measure as the measurement value."
measurement,unit_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,A foreign key to a standard concept identifier of measurement units in the Vocabulary.
measurement,unit_source_value,Yes,,,varchar,,"The source code for the unit as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard unit concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference."
measurement,value_as_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,integer,,"A foreign key to an observation result stored as a concept identifier. This is applicable to observations where the result can be expressed as a standard concept from the Vocabulary (e.g., positive/negative, present/absent, low/high, etc.)."
measurement,value_as_number,No,,,float,,The measurement result stored as a number. This is applicable to measurements where the result is expressed as a numeric value.
measurement,value_source_value,Yes,,,varchar,,The source value associated with the structured value stored as numeric or concept. This field can be used in instances where the source data are transformed
measurement,visit_occurrence_id,No,visit_occurrence,visit_occurrence_id,integer,,A foreign key to the visit in the visit table during which the observation was recorded.
